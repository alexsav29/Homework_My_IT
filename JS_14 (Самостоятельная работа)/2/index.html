    <p><a href="">Tooltips</a> can be attached to any element. When you hover the element with your mouse, the title attribute is displayed in a little box next to the element, just like a native tooltip.</p>

    <p>But as it's not a native tooltip, it can be styled. Any themes built with <a href="">ThemeRoller</a> will also style tooltips accordingly.</p>

    <p>Tooltips are also useful for form elements, to show some additional information in the context of each field.</p>

    <form>
        Your age:
        <input type="text">
    </form>

    <p>Hover the field to see the tooltip. We ask for your age only for statistical purposes.</p>
